### INTRODUCTION
In this case study, KMeans and OpenCV algorithms were used.

It consists of 3 parts: The first part is preparing the image for color detection by preprocessing with OpenCV. The second part is detecting the 5 main colors in the photo and showing their percentages. The third part is calculating and displaying the percentages of red, white, and dark gray colors in the photo.

Before each code section, the purpose of the code is explained.

Within the code sections, explanations of the functions and processes are provided.
